## Functional Requirements

1. **Student/Buddy registration**
-1.1. Sign-up details - The buddy and student will both have to register by filling up a questionnaire. However, both will have different registration processes.
--1.1.1. Student - Filling up of personal details followed by a simple set of personality and preference questions. Before registration, the student is allowed to prioritise his/her sections based on preference.
--1.1.2. Buddy - Similar to the former, but does not include the set of preference questions. We take note of the availability and timings of the buddies so that they are approachable face-to-face during that period.
--1.1.3. The user should be able to save his/her details and proceed to using the app after clicking the 'Register' button.
-1.2. Data Security - The information of the users will only be stored until the end of the student's course. All details will be erased after the end of the academic year and will be refreshed the following year.


2. **Medium of Communication**
-2.1. E-mails - Since the student and the buddy register with their e-mails, they can communicate with each other through the same. However, the app caters to other social media as well. Namely:
--2.1.1. Facebook/Messenger - One of the most common social media in the market. We have integrated the messenger service on our app
--2.1.2. WeChat - Considering the ban of common messaging services like WhatsApp in markets such as China, Bangladesh and Iran, we offer the students to chat with their buddy through an alternative known as WeChat.

3. **Central Space**
-3.1. App Community - One of the core functions of the app.The community is identical to a social group where buddies and students can communicate as an entire group. The community focuses on two main features:
--3.1.1. Events and Activities - Static pages which contains details of the upcoming events will be linked to the community. The user should be able to view the respective event on a button click and will be redirected to another page.
--3.1.2. Announcements - The administrative team has access to the community to update all users about the key activities, updates and deadlines.

4. **Student-Buddy Matching**
-4.1. Matching Algorithm - The crux of the application. The student after registration, must fill in the questionnaire in order to get matched with a buddy with similar interests (buddies are pre registered volunteers). The questionnaire is primarily focused on 3 criteria:
-4.1.1. Personality - Basic questions on how the student feels about him/herself. Includes socialising, interests and hobbies.
-4.1.2. Motivations - To understand the student's motivations in life and passion for the respective course.
-4.1.3. Expectations - To essentially see and understand the student's expectations from the university and the people.
-4.2. Prioritising - After filling in the questionnaire, we give the students the liberty to prioritise their criteria so that it improves our matching search as well has helps them get the right buddy.
