# Project Overview 

The University of Bristol International Office is launching a new Global Transfer Programme for students studying abroad to transfer to specific programmes. To smoothen this process,  the University is promoting the development of a **mobile Android application** that would match these students with a buddy that would help guide them through their stay. 

## Domain of Application
Since we are doing this project for the University of Bristol International Office, the domain of our application is going to be primarily in the Higher-Education sector. 


## The Problem
* A June 2018 Study by The Netherlands-Based Erasmus Student Network found that two out of 3 international students regularly experienced loneliness.
* Initially, International students would have to acclimatise to a whole new culture aswell tackling the usual struggles that come with life in University without an already established support base.
* It is well known that deeper relationships with peers and communities can start to ease emotional stress so International students can have a more positive experience over the course of their degree.
## Proposed Solution

This Application should become a social space for the students to congregate along with an integrated **messaging service** to enable communication between students and buddies. The **students should be matched with buddies based on common personality traits** aswell as a list of priorities assigned by the student including nationality, age , gender or course.The International Office should be able to push through notifications on upcoming events and deadlines aswell as oversee the database of currently active buddies and students.
