# Project Overview 

The University of Bristol International Office is launching a new Global Transfer Programme for students studying abroad to transfer to specific programmes at Bristol.Coming to the UK can become a culture shock and heightens feelings of loneliness for many students. To address these issues ,our client is promoting the development of a **mobile Android application** that would match these students with a buddy that would help guide and support them through their stay. 

## Client Description

The University of Bristol International Office is responsible for engaging with prospective students overseas and helping with any general inquiries regarding admissions.We are primarily working with the International Student Recruitment Team who are responsible for promoting the university abroad to improve the university experience for study abroad students. The client already has a _Buddy_ system in place where students are matched with their buddy manually through human effort so most of our efforts will be focused on automating this process. 




## Application Domain
Since our client is the University of Bristol International Office, the domain of our application is going to be primarily in the Higher-Education sector. The application itself is a social media application since we have to provide means of communication between buddies and students through a messaging service and a social events calendar.Our application also needs to function on an international domain so we cannot just rely on Google and Facebook services since it is not available in study abroad scheme hotspots such as China. Our application would add to the support scheme already in place for students by our client so we must limit the application to the domain that is already established.Our application will be primarily used within the University. 


## The Problem
* A June 2018 Study by The Netherlands-Based Erasmus Student Network found that two out of 3 international students regularly experienced loneliness.
* Initially, International students would have to acclimatise to a whole new culture aswell tackling the usual struggles that come with life in University without an already established support base.
* It is well known that deeper relationships with peers and communities can start to ease emotional stress so International students can have a more positive experience over the course of their degree.
## Proposed Solution

This Application should become a social space for the students to congregate along with an integrated **messaging service** to enable communication between students and buddies. The **students should be matched with buddies based on common personality traits** aswell as a list of preferences assigned by the student including nationality, age , gender or course.The International Office should be able to push through notifications on upcoming events and deadlines aswell as oversee the database of currently active buddies and students.
