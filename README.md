# Bristol Buddies

The university of Bristol is launching a brand new Global Transfer Programme that will enable students studying at select overseas university partners to transfer onto specific programmes. To make sure transfer students are supported adjusting to life in Bristol they are launching the **Bristol Buddies** scheme. The scheme will match transfer students with current students (their “Buddy”) who will volunteer their time to provide regular peer support and act as a reliable point of contact to help with the integration of transfer students.  

To facilitate this process, we are charged to create a mobile Android application that helps connect incoming transfer students with their matched buddy.  The application should provide a platform to connect students with their buddies, and integrate a messaging service so they can communicate. Ideally, the buddies would be matched to the students based  on common matches in personality traits, motivations and expectations. The university will be able to sent administrative announcements to all users of the app to update them on key activities and deadlines.  



The application will be developed utilising the MIT license.
